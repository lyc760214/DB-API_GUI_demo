# DB-API_GUI_demo
Using Perl to build a DB-API GUI demo by Tk and Net::MySQL module


# You need to install two modules
Tk:
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Tk/pod/UserGuide.pod

Net::MySQL
http://search.cpan.org/~tsucchi/Net-MySQL-0.11/MySQL.pm



# Something you should know
This demo just use localhost and port:3306
If you need to change hostname and port,
you can change subroutine "submit_do".



# System
OS: OpenSuse 42.3
Perl: 5.26.0
Tk: 804.034
Net::MySQL: 0.11


# Others
This is just a practice, and you can change
anthing if you like.
